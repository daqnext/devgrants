# Open Grant Proposal: `Meson`

**Name of Project:** Meson

**Proposal Category:** `app-dev`

**Proposer:** Haihong Shi

**Do you agree to open source all work you do on behalf of this RFP and dual-license under MIT and APACHE2 licenses?:** "Yes"


# Project Description
Filecoin&IPFS focus on distributed storage, but there are many limitations when it comes to nowadays's popular applications like video streaming, gaming, etc.
Because popular applications often require high bandwidth in file transmission besides the file storage capacity. But Filecoin&IPFS only focus on storage capacity. We are building a project called 'meson' which is a distributed file acceleration cache layer over Filecoin&IPFS. Meson is the layer2 that increases the whole bandwidth over Filecoin&IPFS, and it caches the hot files from Filecoin&IPFS globally. 

## Value
According to the market, a popular application called 'tiktok' spends billions on file transmission each year.[CDN] Currently, Filecoin&IPFS network has a lot of storage capacity, but files stored on the network are not efficiently used. Meson will bring down the cost of file transmission while using Filecoin &IPFS and bring Filecoin&IPFS into real commercial applications.


### What are the benefits to getting this right?
There are three parts to the benefits.

1.For Filecoin&IPFS miners, they can run meson directly on top of Filecoin&IPFS. Miners will receive more money from commercial applications while transmitting the hot files.

2.For traditional application companies like 'tiktok', they can reduce the payment to centralized CDN providers and benefit from distributed storage and transmission.

3.For Filecoin&IPFS ecosystem, meson will help to increase the bandwidth of file transmission of the whole network. This will bring more commercial applications into Filecoin&IPFS ecosystem.

### What are the risks if you don't get it right?
Filecoin&IPFS has relatively low risk as we have already built the test network. It validates our idea and works pretty well. Filecoin&IPFS has low risk as the budget is paid on milestones and each milestone has defined deliverables.

### What are the risks that will make executing on this project difficult?
At present, we have not seen any risks that will make executing on this project difficult.
